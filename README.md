Live templates for the Flybits SDK

Installation:

These templates give quick shortcuts to implementing some of the Flybits API. They are all prefixed with ``fb``. These templates will appear in the autocomplete as you type them out. Some may have variations, such as `fblogine`, `fblogina`, and `fblogins` which do **E**mail Login, **A**nonymous Login, and **S**yntheticId Login.

Template Shortcuts:
- Initialization
- Login (Using email, syntheticId, anonymously)
- Logout
